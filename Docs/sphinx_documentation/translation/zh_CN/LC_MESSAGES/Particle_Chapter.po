"In addition to the tools for working with mesh data described in previous"
" chapters, AMReX also provides data structures and iterators for "
"performing data-parallel particle simulations. Our approach is "
"particularly suited to particles that interact with data defined on a "
"(possibly adaptive) block-structured hierarchy of meshes. Example "
"applications include Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations, Lagrangian "
"tracers, or particles that exert drag forces onto a fluid, such as in "
"multi-phase flow calculations. The overall goals of AMReX's particle "
"tools are to allow users flexibility in specifying how the particle data "
"is laid out in memory and to handle the parallel communication of "
"particle data. In the following sections, we give an overview of AMReX's "
"particle classes and how to use them."
