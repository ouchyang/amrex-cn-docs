"In this chapter, we present the basics of AMReX. The implementation "
"source codes are in ``amrex/Src/Base/``. Note that AMReX classes and "
"functions are in namespace ``amrex``. For clarity, we usually drop "
"``amrex::`` in the example codes here. It is also assumed that headers "
"have been properly included. We recommend you study the tutorial in "
"``amrex-tutorials/ExampleCodes/Basic/HeatEquation_EX1_C`` while reading "
"this chapter.  After reading this chapter, one should be able to develop "
"single-level parallel codes using AMReX. It should also be noted that "
"this is not a comprehensive reference manual."
