"In this chapter, we discuss AMReX's build systems. Additionally, it is "
"also possible to install AMReX using Spack (https://spack.io/). For more "

"There are three ways to use AMReX's build systems. Most AMReX developers "
"use GNU Make. With this approach, there is no installation step; "
"application codes adopt AMReX's build system and compile AMReX while "
"compiling their own codes. This will be discussed in more detail in the "
"section on :ref:`sec:build:make`."

msgid ""
"The second approach is to build and install AMReX as a library using GNU "
"make (:ref:`sec:build:lib`); an application code then uses its own build "
"system and links to AMReX as an external library."

"AMReX requires a C++ compiler that supports the C++17 standard, a Fortran"
" compiler that supports the Fortran 2003 standard, and a C compiler that "
"supports the C99 standard.  Prerequisites for building with GNU Make "
"include Python (>= 2.7, including 3) and standard tools available in any "
"Unix-like environments (e.g., Perl and sed).  For building with CMake, "
"the minimal requirement is version 3.18."

"Please note that we fully support AMReX for Linux systems in general and "
"on the DOE supercomputers (e.g. Cori, Summit) in particular.  Many of our"
" users do build and use AMReX on Macs but we do not have the resources to"
" fully support Mac users."
