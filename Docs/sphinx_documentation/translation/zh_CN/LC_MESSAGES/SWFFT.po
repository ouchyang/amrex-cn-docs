"``hacc/SWFFT``, developed by Adrian Pope et al. at Argonne National Lab, "
"provides the functionality to perform forward and reverse Fast Fourier "
"Transforms (FFT) within a fully parallelized framework built in C++ and "
"F90. In the words of HACC's developers, SWFFT is a \"distributed-memory, "
"pencil-decomposed, parallel 3D FFT.\" [1]_ The SWFFT source code is also "
"contained in the following directory within AMReX: "
"``amrex/Src/Extern/SWFFT``. [2]_"

"As input, SWFFT takes three-dimensional arrays of data distributed across"
" block-structured grids, and redistributes the data into \"pencil\" grids"
" in :math:`z, x,` and then :math:`y`, belonging to different MPI "
"processes. After each pencil conversion, a 1D FFT is performed on the "
"data along the pencil direction using calls to the FFTW [3]_ library. The"
" ``README`` files in the tutorial directories specify the relationship "
"between the number of grids and the number of MPI processes that should "
"be used. The ``hacc/SWFFT`` ``README`` document by Adrian Pope et al. "
"explains restrictions on grid dimensions in relation to the number of MPI"
" processes [1]_  [2]_:"

"[...] A rule of thumb is that [SWFFT] generally works when the number of "
"vertices along one side of the global 3D grid (\"ng\") can be factored "
"into small primes, and when the number of MPI ranks can also be factored "
"into small primes. I believe that all of the unique prime factors of the "
"number of MPI ranks must be present in the set of prime factors of the "
"grid, eg. if you have 20 MPI ranks then ng must be a multiple of 5 and 2."
" The ``CheckDecomposition`` utility is provided to check (on one rank) "
"whether a proposed grid size and number of MPI ranks will work, which can"
" be done before submitting a large test with ``TestDfft/TestFDfft``."
