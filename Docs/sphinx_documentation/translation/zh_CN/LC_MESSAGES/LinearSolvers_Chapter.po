"AMReX supports both single-level solves and composite solves on multiple "
"AMR levels, with the scalar solution to the linear system defined on "
"either cell centers or nodes. AMReX also supports solution of linear "
"systems with embedded boundaries. (See chapter :ref:`Chap:EB` for more "
"details on the embedded boundary representation of complex geometry.)"
