msgid ""
"In AMReX-based applications that have both mesh data and particle data, "
"the mesh work and particle work have very different requirements for load"
" balancing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Rather than using a combined work estimate to create the same grids for "
"mesh and particle data, we have the option to pursue a \"dual grid\" "
"approach."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With this approach the mesh (:cpp:`MultiFab`) and particle "
"(:cpp:`ParticleContainer`) data are allocated on different "
":cpp:`BoxArrays` with different :cpp:`DistributionMappings`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/DualGrid.rst:21 e8b19c67c90342dca8cdf0146673f309
msgid ""
"This enables separate load balancing strategies to be used for the mesh "
"and particle work."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/DualGrid.rst:23 99644a0160544c2bb095d075fafc21ba
msgid ""
"The cost of this strategy, of course, is the need to copy mesh data onto "
"temporary :cpp:`MultiFabs` defined on the particle :cpp:`BoxArrays` when "
"mesh-particle communication is required."
