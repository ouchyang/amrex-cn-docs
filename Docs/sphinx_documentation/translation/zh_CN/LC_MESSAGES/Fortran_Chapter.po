"The core of AMReX is written in C++. For Fortran users who want to write "
"all of their programs in Fortran, AMReX provides Fortran interfaces "
"around most of functionalities except for the :cpp:`AmrLevel` class (see "
"the chapter on :ref:`Chap:AmrLevel`) and particles (see the chapter on "
":ref:`Chap:Particles`). We should not confuse the Fortran interface in "
"this chapter with the Fortran kernel functions called inside "
":cpp:`MFIter` loops in codes (see the section on "
":ref:`sec:basics:fortran`). For the latter, Fortran is used in some sense"
" as a domain-specific language with native multi-dimensional arrays, "
"whereas here Fortran is used to drive the whole application code. In "
"order to better understand AMReX, Fortran interface users should read the"
" rest of the documentation except for the Chapters on "
":ref:`Chap:AmrLevel` & :ref:`Chap:Particles`."
