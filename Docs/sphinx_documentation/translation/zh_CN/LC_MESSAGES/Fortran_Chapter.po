"The core of AMReX is written in C++. For Fortran users who want to write all of their programs in Fortran, AMReX "
"provides Fortran interfaces around most of functionalities except for the :cpp:`AmrLevel` class (see the chapter on "
":ref:`Chap:AmrLevel`) and particles (see the chapter on :ref:`Chap:Particles`). We should not confuse the Fortran "
"interface in this chapter with the Fortran kernel functions called inside :cpp:`MFIter` loops in codes (see the section "
"on :ref:`sec:basics:fortran`). For the latter, Fortran is used in some sense as a domain-specific language with native "
"multi-dimensional arrays, whereas here Fortran is used to drive the whole application code. In order to better "
"understand AMReX, Fortran interface users should read the rest of the documentation except for the Chapters on "
":ref:`Chap:AmrLevel` & :ref:`Chap:Particles`."

"AMReX的核心是用C++编写的。对于希望完全使用Fortran编写程序的Fortran用户，AMReX提供了Fortran接口，覆盖了大部分功能，除了:cpp:`AmrLevel`类（请参阅:ref:`Chap:AmrLevel`"
"章节）和粒子（请参阅:ref:`Chap:Particles`章节）。我们不应该将本章中的Fortran接口与代码中:cpp:`MFIter`循环内调用的Fortran内核函数混淆（请参阅:ref:`sec:basics:fortran`"
"节）。对于后者，Fortran在某种程度上被用作具有本地多维数组的领域特定语言，而在这里，Fortran用于驱动整个应用程序代码。为了更好地理解AMReX，Fortran接口用户应该阅读除了:ref:`Chap:AmrLevel`"
"和:ref:`Chap:Particles`章节之外的其他文档内容。"
