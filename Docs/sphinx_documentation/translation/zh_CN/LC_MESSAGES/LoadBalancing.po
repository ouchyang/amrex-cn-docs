"The process of load balancing is typically independent of the process of "
"grid creation; the inputs to load balancing are a given set of grids with"
" a set of weights assigned to each grid.  (The exception to this is the "
"KD-tree approach in which the grid creation process is governed by trying"
" to balance the work in each grid.)"

"Single-level load balancing algorithms are sequentially applied to each "
"AMR level independently, and the resulting distributions are mapped onto "
"the ranks taking into account the weights already assigned to them "
"(assign heaviest set of grids to the least loaded rank).  Note that the "
"load of each process is measured by how much memory has already been "
"allocated, not how much memory will be allocated.  Therefore the "
"following code is not recommended because it tends to generate non-"
"optimal distributions."

"Knapsack: the default weight of a grid in the knapsack algorithm is the "
"number of grid cells, but AMReX supports the option to pass an array of "
"weights -- one per grid -- or alternatively to pass in a MultiFab of "
"weights per cell which is used to compute the weight per grid."
