"In this Chapter, we restrict our use to the ``amrex/Src/AmrCore`` source "
"code and present a tutorial that performs an adaptive, subcycling-in-time"
" simulation of the advection equation for a passively advected scalar.  "
"The accompanying tutorial code is available in ``amrex-"
"tutorials/ExampleCodes/Amr/Advection_AmrCore`` with build/run directory "
"``Exec/SingleVortex``. In this example, the velocity field is a specified"
" function of space and time, such that an initial Gaussian profile is "
"displaced but returns to its original configuration at the final time.  "
"The boundary conditions are periodic and we use a refinement ratio of "
":math:`r=2` between each AMR level. The results of the simulation in two-"
"dimensions are depicted in the Table showing the :ref:`SingleVortex "
"Tutorial<fig:Adv>`."
