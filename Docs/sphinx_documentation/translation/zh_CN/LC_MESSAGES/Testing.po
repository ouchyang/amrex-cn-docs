"As a first line of testing, on every commit to the repository, we verify "
"that we can compile AMReX as a library for a common set of configuration "
"options. This operation is performed through Travis-CI. This layer of "
"testing is deliberately limited, so that it can be run quickly on every "
"commit. For more extensive testing, we rely on the nightly regression "
"results."

"Each night, we automatically run a suite of tests, both on AMReX itself, "
"and on a most of the major application codes that use it as a framework. "
"We use an in-house test runner script to manage this operation, "
"originally developed by Michael Zingale for the Castro code, and later "
"expanded to other application codes as well. The results for each night "
"are collected and stored on a web page; see "
"https://ccse.lbl.gov/pub/RegressionTesting/ for the latest set of "
"results. The runtime option ``amrex.abort_on_unused_inputs`` (``0`` or "
"``1``; default is ``0`` for false) is useful for making sure that tests "
"always stay up to date with API changes as it will abort the application "
"after the test run if any unused input parameters were detected."

"The test suite is mostly used internally by AMReX developers. However, if"
" you are making a pull request to AMReX, it can be useful to run the test"
" suite on your local machine to reduce the likelihood that your changes "
"break some existing functionality. To run the test suite locally, you "
"must first obtain a copy of the test runner source, available on Github "
"here: https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/regression_testing. The test runner "
"requires Python version 2.7 or greater. Additional information on the "
"test suite software can be found at, https://amrex-"
